## Triple Storage Manager (3storage)



#### Page file server (PFS)

* Page file is a sequence of pages
       * A *page* is a basic unit of processing
       * All pages have the same length
       * A *page identifier* (abbr. `pgid`) points to the beginning of the given page (offset of a page in page file)
       * The page FS does not know anything about the contents of pages
* Architecture of Page file server
       * Page server is an Erlang process
       * Page file server accepts requests from many (ISAM) processes
       * N-th page is accessed by reading|writting from|to the position n*page-size in db file
       * Requests are placed in a queue and served one by one
             * Erlang process `pid` is stored for each request
             * (to-do) Does it make sense to have sessions (with a given process `pid`)?
       * Buffer manager is serving as a cache
             * Page are read into buffer pool
             * Some page replacement strategy should be used
* Page server interface
       * `read pgid N` command reads a sequence of `N` pages starting at the page `pgid`
       * `write pgid N` command writes a sequence of `N` pages to the db file

#### ISAM index

* ISAM index is a key/value store
       * Keys/Values are stored in pages
             * Keys are composed of instances of `K` subseteq {`S,P,O`}
             * Values can be either complete triples or references to triples
       * Index pagemms are storing keys/pointers to subtrees
       * Data pages store entered keys/values
             * A `value` can be either a pointer or a complete triple
             * In the case triples are stored in data pages, we have a triple file organization
             * A triple file implements one of seven possible orderings of triples
* Architecture of ISAM index
       * ISAM index is an Erlang module and process
       * ISAM index is stored in a file of pages
             * ISAM index module includes a reference (`pid`) of a PFS Erlang process
       * (to-do) To implement *cursors* in TP-AM we need to remember the position of *index cursor*
             * At exactly what position the prevous read stoped
             * We expect further reading
       * Receiving pages from PFS
             * Index pages are read to ISAM process and they are processed in ISAM process.
             * Data pages should be directed to TP-AM process (if possible)
       * We can have dense/sparse indexes... this should be illuminated
             * (iztok) I suggest that we have **sparse** index
             * The last index level includes `<key,ptr>` where `ptr` points to data page
             * The next `<key,ptr>` points to the next data page
* ISAM index interface
       * `qid = open key cp` opens access for a given `key` where `cp` is one of comparison operations equal|eq-more-then|eq-less-then
             * The result of
       * `read qid` reads all results of the operation
       * `Å•ead qid N` read the next `N` results
       * `close qid` closes access to ISAM index
       * Batch creation of ISAM index from complete data

###Record-based file server (RFS).

* Record file is a sequence of records
       * Records are the basic units of operation
       * All records have the same length
       * Record identifier (RID) identifies a record
       * RFS does not know anything about the content of records
* Architecture of RFS
       * PFS is an Erlang process
       * Records are stored in pages
       * RID = sequential number of a record in a file. PID = RID / (num.of records per page).
* RFS interface
       * Initialization of the RFS process
       * Read N-th record
       * Write a new record to the end of file

Draft material.

###Interrelations

* PFS is a separate process as defined above
* One ISAM process works with an open PFS process
       * The results of an ISAM index access are the leaf pages, more precisely,
          key/value records in leaf pages.
       * In initial version ISAM can read also the results, but it seems that
         the results can be sent directly to the initiator of ISAM process, i.e.,
         the TP-AM process (triple-pattern access method).
