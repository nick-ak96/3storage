#  Architecture of 3storage

#### Page file server (PFS)

* Page file is a sequence of pages
   * A *page* is a basic unit of processing
   * All pages have the same length
   * A *page identifier* (abbr. `pgid`) points to the beginning of the given page (offset of a page in page file)
   * The page FS does not know anything about the contents of pages
* Architecture of Page file server
   * Page server is an Erlang process
   * Page file server accepts requests from many (ISAM) processes
   * N-th page is accessed by reading|writting from|to the position n*page-size in db file
   * Requests are placed in a queue and served one by one
       * Erlang process `pid` is stored for each request
       * (to-do) Does it make sense to have sessions (with a given process `pid`)?
   * Buffer manager is serving as a cache
       * Page are read into buffer pool
       * Some page replacement strategy should be used
* Page server interface
   * `read pgid N` command reads a sequence of `N` pages starting at the page `pgid`
   * `write pgid N` command writes a sequence of `N` pages to the db file

#### ISAM index

* ISAM index is a key/value store
   * Keys/Values are stored in data (leaf) pages
       * Keys are composed of instances of `K` subseteq {`S,P,O`}
       * A `value` can be either a pointer or a complete triple
   * Index pages are storing keys/pointers to subtrees
   * In the case triples are stored in data pages, we have a triple file organization
       * A triple file implements one of seven possible orderings of triples
* Architecture of ISAM index
  * ISAM index is an Erlang module and process
  * ISAM index is stored in a file of pages
       * ISAM index module includes a reference (`pid`) of a PFS Erlang process
  * (to-do) To implement *cursors* in TP-AM we need to remember the position of *index cursor*
       * At exactly what position the prevous read stoped
       * We expect further reading
  * Receiving pages from PFS
       * Index pages are read to ISAM process and they are processed in ISAM process.
       * Data pages should be directed to TP-AM process (if possible)
  * We can have dense/sparse indexes... this should be illuminated
       * (iztok) I suggest that we have **sparse** index
       * The last index level includes `<key,ptr>` where `ptr` points to data page
       * The next `<key,ptr>` points to the next data page
* ISAM index interface
  * `qid = open key cp` opens access for a given `key` where `cp` is one of comparison operations equal|eq-more-then|eq-less-then
  * `read qid` reads all results of the operation
  * `Å•ead qid N` read the next `N` results
  * `close qid` closes access to ISAM index
  * Batch creation of ISAM index from complete data

### Record-based file server (RFS).

* Record file is a sequence of records
   * Records are the basic units of operation
   * All records have the same length
   * Record identifier (RID) identifies a record
   * RFS does not know anything about the content of records
* Architecture of RFS
   * PFS is an Erlang process
   * Records are stored in pages
   * RID = sequential number of a record in a file. PID = RID / (num.of records per page).
* RFS interface
   * Initialization of the RFS process
   * Read N-th record
   * Write a new record to the end of file


### Triple-pattern access method

* Triple-pattern access method (TP-AM) is a query node
    - TP-AM is a leaf of a query tree
    - A description is available at [https://big3store.github.io/big3store/](https://big3store.github.io/big3store/)
* Architecture of TP-AM
    - TP-AM is an Erlang process
    - Triple-pattern obtained from the message {start ...}
    - TP-AM creates ISAM index process if it does not exist
    - TP-AM opens the access to the ISAM index by providing the access parameters (key+operation)
    - The results of the query run at ISAM index process is obtained via messages from a PFS process
        - Each message contains a data block that is parsed and processed by TP-AM
    - After processing the triples (selection) they are collected in the stream blocks which are sent to the parent query node
    - The protocol of TP-AM is based on
        - the internal state active, db_access, eos, or inactive
        - messages obtained from a PFS process (stored in input queue after receival)
        - state of input and output queues
* TP-AM interface
    - TP-AM accepts synchronous messages
        - {start, QNodeId, QueryId, SessionId, TriplePattern, ...} and 
        - {eval, VarsValues}
    - TP-AM accepts asynchronous messages
        - {empty, From} and
        - {stop, From}



## Draft material

### Interrelations

* PFS is a separate process as defined above
* One ISAM process works with an open PFS process
   * The results of an ISAM index access are the leaf pages, more precisely, key/value records in leaf pages.
   * In initial version ISAM can read also the results, but it seems that the results can be sent directly to the initiator of ISAM process, i.e., the TP-AM process (triple-pattern access method).
