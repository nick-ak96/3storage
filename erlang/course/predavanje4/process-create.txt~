Process creation
----------------

There is no inherent hierarchy among processes.

The designer of an application may explicitly create such a hierarchy.

Process creation

Pid = spawn(Module, FunctionName, ArgumentList)

Pids are used for all forms of communication with a process. 

The call to spawn/3 

    returns immediately when the new process has been created and 
    does not wait for the given function to evaluate.

Process Pid1 spawns Pid2.

Pid2 = spawn(Mod, Func, Args)

Pid1 and Pid2 are executing concurrently.

The process identifier of the Pid2, is now known only to process Pid1.

     Erlang security system is based on restricting the spread of 
     the Pid of a process

A process terminates when the evaluation of the function is completed.

Pid is a data object a any other object like the integer.

Inter-process Communication
---------------------------

Communication between processes is by message passing, only.

Pid ! Message

A message can be any valid Erlang term. 

send (!) is a primitive which evaluates its arguments.

foo(12) ! bar(baz)

The order of evaluation is undefined.

send returns the message sent as its value.

Asynchronous nature of message passing 

     sending a message is an asynchronous operation (no waiting)
     application level synchronisation
     message sent to the terminated process does not notify the sender

Messages are always delivered to the recipient. 

     Messages are delivered in the same order they were sent.

The primitive receive is used to receive messages. 

receive
    Message1 [when Guard1] ->
        Actions1 ;
    Message2 [when Guard2] ->
        Actions2 ;
    ...
end

Process has a mailbox storing messages in the order of arrival.

Message1 and Message2 are patterns: 

    matched against messages that are in the processâ€™s mailbox, 
    removed from the mailbox and 
    then the corresponding ActionsN are evaluated.

Messages in the mailbox that are not selected by receive 

    remain in the mailbox in the same order as they were stored and 
    matched against in the next receive. 

receive returns the value of the last expression evaluated in the actions.

process evaluating receive will be suspended until a message is matched.

    selective receive mechanism 
    no message arriving unexpectedly at a process can block other messages
    make sure that the system does not fill up with such messages.

Order of receiving messages
---------------------------

receive tries to match each message in the mailbox with each pattern.

Let a process mailbox contain messages msg_1, msg_2,msg_3 and msg_4 in that order. 
 
Evaluating

receive
    msg_3 ->
        ...
end

gives the mailbox with messages msg_1, msg_2 and msg_4. 

Evaluating 

receive
    msg_4 ->
        ...
    msg_2 ->
        ...
end

gives the mailbox msg_1 and msg_4. 

Evaluating

receive
    AnyMessage ->
        ...
end

gives the mailbox msg_4.

Ordering of message patterns in a receive does not directly
implement priority of messages.

Receiving messages from a specific process
------------------------------------------

We want to receive messages from a specific process. 

Sender must explicitly include its own process identifier in the message:

Pid ! {self(),abc}

The BIF self() returns the identifier of the calling process.

This could be received by:

receive
    {Pid,Msg} ->
        ...
end

receive as above would receive messages only from process Pid.
